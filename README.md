## Introduction

The datasets that data professionals use to solve problems typically contain missing values, which must be dealt with in order to achieve clean, useful data.   
This is particularly crucial in exploratory data analysis (EDA). In this problem, I am showing how I address missing data. 

## Scenario
As a financial data consultant, and an investor has tasked my team with identifying new business opportunities. To help them decide which future companies to invest in, I will provide a list of current businesses valued at more than $1 billion. These are sometimes referred to as "unicorns." My client will use this information to learn about profitable businesses in general.

The investor tasked me to provide them with the following data: 
1. Companies in the `hardware` industry based in `Beijing`, `San Francisco`, and `London` 
2. Companies in the `artificial intelligence` industry based in `London`
3. A list of the top 20 countries sorted by sum of company valuations in each country, excluding `United States`, `China`, `India`, and `United Kingdom`
4.  A global valuation map of all countries except `United States`, `China`, `India`, and `United Kingdom`

Included in the data is a list of businesses and data points, such as the year they were founded; their industry; and their city, country, and continent. 

Results of investors request:

1. Companies in the `hardware` industry based in `Beijing`, `San Francisco`, and `London`
2. Companies in the `artificial intelligence` industry based in `London`
